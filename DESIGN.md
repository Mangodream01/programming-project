##### Map of Europe
A map of Europe will be created by zooming in on the d3 World Map. Information over the time course 2008-2014 can be viewed by means of a slider. In total, eleven windows can be chosen in which another variable will be displayed by color code. For this matter, it is important to implement a convenient dictionary with country codes pointing to the years, and years pointing to the rest of the variables. *See image 1.*
##### Graph of parallel coordinates
In this graph, the user can play with all eleven variables of multiple countries. *See image 2.*
