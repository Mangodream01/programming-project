#### Map of Europe
A map of Europe will be created by zooming in on the d3 World Map. Information over the time course 2006-2014 can be viewed by means of a slider. In total, eleven windows can be chosen in which another variable will be displayed by color code. For this matter, it is important to implement a convenient dictionary with country codes pointing to the years, and years pointing to the rest of the variables. See image 1.
#### Graph of parallel coordinates
In this graph, the user can play with all eleven variables of multiple countries. See image 2. In this way, patterns and relationships between variables can come forward. A possible relationship can be analyzed more closely in visualization 3.
#### Scatter plot
A scatterplot will display the relationship between two happiness variables. The user can choose ‘variable x, variable y’ by means of a dropdown menu. All eleven variables can be chosen.
