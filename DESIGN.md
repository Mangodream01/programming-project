#### Europe map
A map of Europe will be created by zooming in on the d3 World Map. Information over the time course 2008-2014 can by viewed by means of a slider. In total, eleven windows can be chosen in which another variable will be displayed by color code.

*Dataset 1 Happiness variables:*
1* "Healthy life expectancy at birth": "70.51219177",
2* "Positive affect": "0.659085035",
3* "Generosity": "-0.000629284",
4 "country": "Slovenia",
5* "Perceptions of corruption": "0.892197907",
6* "Democratic Quality": "",
7* "Freedom to make life choices": "0.896007299",
8* "Life Ladder": "5.740642071",
9* "Confidence in national government": "0.202604815",
10 "year": "2015",
11* "Log GDP per capita": "10.26922512",
12* "Social support": "0.901163757",
13* "Negative affect": "0.26141873"

For this matter, it is important to implement a convenient dictionary with country codes pointing to the years, and years pointing to the rest of the variables.
      
When a country gets clicked on, a list appears of variables with corresponding values. Moreover, a graph of parallel coordinates will be implemented to play with the variables, and compare those of different EU countries with eachother. Furthermore, a bar chart will demonstrate a new dataset: drug use per country.

*Dataset 2 Drugs variabeles:*
1 Amphetamines in EU countries
2 Cannabis in EU countries
3 Cocaine in EU countries
4 Ecstacy-like drugs in EU countries
5 Opiates in EU countries
