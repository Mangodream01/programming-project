I found a nice dataset with numbers of drug intake per country. I decided to converge my project on countries in Europe, and zoomed in on Europe on the d3 World Map in JavaScript and HTML. Later I also found a complete dataset with happiness variables. I thought of looking for an association between a countriesâ€™ happiness and drug intake. I made templates for my Javascript, HTML, and CSS files.

I cleaned up the whole happiness dataset in excel, and converted it to csv file. Read it into python, and now busy with converting it into JSON. I found country codes to link it to my map. Getting it in right dictionary format is harder than I expected.

##### 08-06-2017 
Converted csv to json in python in the way I wanted. Loaded it into the JavaScript file and connected it with the EU map. I displayed colors on the map based on one variable from the happiness dataset. Tomorrow I want to look at a function to make buckets with evenly divided data points for color coding (maybe in python in the json file) and a legend that adjust automatically (maybe d3 has one).

##### 09-06-2017 
I made buckets for EU countries in python, picked multiple color gradients, and wrote a first legend in JS. I played around with my EU map and its style. I improved my csv-to-json python script and my JS code. I also started writing code for tooltips with country names and scores to see if values correspond with color coding.
