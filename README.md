### Project proposal: ‘medicalization of misery?’

In this programming project, European countries will be researched within the framework of ‘happiness’ (World Happiness Report). A map of Europe will display various variables that are measured between 2008-2014 (color code (d3 color scale gradient) over separate windows), and changes over these years can be viewed by means of a time slider. When clicked on, the variable values will neatly appear next to the map. Moreover, you can play with the variables through parallel coordinates.

Variables example:
Healthy life expectancy at birth": "70.51219177",
      "Positive affect": "0.659085035",
      "Generosity": "-0.000629284",
      "country": "Slovenia",
      "Perceptions of corruption": "0.892197907",
      "Democratic Quality": "",
      "Freedom to make life choices": "0.896007299",
      "Life Ladder": "5.740642071",
      "Confidence in national government": "0.202604815",
      "year": "2015",
      "Log GDP per capita": "10.26922512",
      "Social support": "0.901163757",
      "Negative affect": "0.26141873"

Secondly, I am interested if a trend can be found in drug use when a country is less or more happy. When clicking on a country, a bar chart appears with the annual prevalence of drug use of five types of drugs (x axis) as percentage of the population between 15-64 years old (unless otherwise indicated) (y axis): prevalence of amphetamines, cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy-type substances, opioids (including other illicit opioids and prescription opioids), and opiates (also includes problem opiate users). Unfortunately, data points per drug type per country are from different years, and, therefore, the most recent year is used and mentioned when hoovering over the bar of interest.
