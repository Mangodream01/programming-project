### Variance in Happiness through Europe (2006-2015)
By Thirza Dado

Happiness is more and more thought to be a useful measure of social progress and, therefore, an important target of public policy. Correspondingly, research to determinants of happiness has been flourishing. On this web page, eleven measurements are displayed of life satisfaction in Europe by the Gallup World Poll. These variables are determined by findings of earlier research, and are considered to play an important role in explaining variation in happiness between countries. Importantly, it should be noticed that these variables indicate interesting notions of correlation (both with each other as with unmeasured factors) rather than reflect clean causal relationships.

#### Map of Europe
At the begin screen, the EU map displays variation of the happiness variable “Life Ladder” in 2012 by color coding. The user can switch variables by clicking on items in the right-sided list. The subtitle and legend change dynamically with the selected variable. Next to every list item, the user can hover over the information icon for an explanation about the variable. Furthermore, the time slider below the map allows the user to view differences in variation over the time course 2006-2015. Lastly, hovering over a country displays a tooltip with country name, variable name, and variable value. Clicking on a country highlights this data point (country in this year) in the other two visualizations. 
#### Parallel coordinates
All eleven happiness variables are displayed in parallel coordinates. As a result, relationships between variables can easily be viewed by the user. By selecting the variable title, each variable axis can be dragged to another position for closer comparison. Selecting a sub-area of a variable axis creates an region of interest (ROI) to clearly view lines of interest. This ROI can be dragged over the axis. Click on the axis again to unselect this ROI. 

*Interaction*

When year is changed by the time slider, the parallel coordinates update by means of a nice transition. The year in the subtitle changes as well. Second, when a country on the map is clicked upon, the corresponding line in the parallel coordinates gets highlighted. Click on the country again to un-highlight this line. 
#### Scatter plot
Switch to the second tab (above the title of the lower visualization). The begin screen displays “Life Ladder” on the X axis and “Log GDP per capita” on the Y Axis. These variables can be changed into any of the eleven happiness variables by selection in the pink dropdown menus on the right side. Data points from specific years can be viewed and unviewed by clicking on the legend items.

*Interaction*

When time is changed by the time slider, only the data points of that specific year are displayed in the scatter plot. The user can click on the legend to make data points of other years appear. Second, when a country on the map is clicked upon, the corresponding dot gets highlighted. Click on the country again to un-highlight this dot.
