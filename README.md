In this programming project, European countries will be researched within the framework of happiness (World Happiness Report). A map of Europe will display one selected variable (of eleven optional happiness variables) in color code that is measured between a time scale of 2006-2015. A time slider makes it possible to view change over the years. The user can switch the displayed happiness variable by clicking on items on a list. Hoovering over a country displays a tooltip with country and variable value. See image 1.

Clicking on a country will light its values up in a graph of parallel coordinates. In this way, it is possible to play with the eleven variables of multiple countries. See image 2. In this way, possible relationships can easily be found.

Furthermore, a scatterplot makes it possible to analyze a relationship between two happiness variables more closely.
