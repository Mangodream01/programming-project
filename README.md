### Project proposal: European happiness and drug use


Thirza Dado (10492682) - Programming project


In this programming project, European countries will be researched within the framework of happiness (World Happiness Report). A map of Europe will display one selected variable (of eleven optional happiness variables) in color code (d3 color scale gradient) that is measured between a time scale of 2008-2014. A time slider makes it possible to view change over the years. The user can switch the displayed happiness variable through a drop down menu. Hoovering over a country displays a tooltip with country and variable value. See image 1.

Clicking on a country will display its values in a graph of parallel coordinates. In this way, it is possible to play with the eleven variables of multiple countries. See image 2.

Moreover, I am interested if a trend can be found in drug use when a country is less or more happy. When clicking on a country, a bar chart appears with the annual prevalence of drug use of five types of drugs (x axis) as percentage of the population between 15-64 years old (unless otherwise indicated) (y axis): prevalence of amphetamines, cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy-type substances, and opiates (also includes problem opiate users). Unfortunately, data points per drug type per country are from different years, and, therefore, the most recent year is used and displayed in a list. See image 2.

If there is time left, I will consider implementing a scatter plot to catch an association between variables of happiness and drug use per country.
